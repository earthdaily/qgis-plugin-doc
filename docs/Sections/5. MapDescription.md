# Map Description

## NDVI Map

The NDVI map is used to understand crop variability within the field (dynamic legend) or between fields (common legend)

## Yield Goal Map

The Yield Goal Map is used to define the yield goal distribution inside the field, based on the field variability. User defines the yield he wants to target for the coming season. The legend is dynamic (going from red to blue), this means the minimum and maximum of the legend is adapted for each field.

This information is used by the grower during the establishment of the inputs plan prior to the season: he can push areas with high potential and decrease areas with low potential. The YGM is used to create variable rates application maps. Based on the yield potential variability of the field, the user can modulate the inputs application on the field.

The user has access to past images of vegetation peak period and will choose an archive map with same crop.  The user can choose between different weather context to build a scenario and define his yield goal map.

## Yield Variability Map

The Yield Variability Map shows the yield variability of the field based on an historic average yield. The legend is dynamic (going from red to blue), this means the minimum and maximum of the legend is adapted for each field.



This information is used by the grower during the establishment of the inputs plan prior to the season: he can push areas with high potential and decrease areas with low potential. The YVM is used to create variable rates application maps. Based on the yield potential variability of the field, the user can modulate the inputs application on the field.

The user has access to past images of vegetation peak period and will choose an archive map with same crop.  The user can choose between different weather context to build a scenario and define his yield map.

## Organic Matter Map

The Organic Matter Variability Map is used to represent the relative organic matter distribution in the field (i.e. the nitrogen available within the soil).

The legend is dynamic (going from red to blue), this means the minimum and maximum of the legend is adapted for each field.

This information is used by the grower during the establishment of the <Strong>fertilization strategy</Strong>, to plan and modulate the nitrogen fertilization.

The Organic Matter Variability Map, combined with a Yield Variability or Yield Goal Map, is used to create <Strong>variable rate nitrogen application map</Strong>. The yield goal map allows setting the nitrogen needs in each area of the field.  By taking into account the nitrogen needs to reach the yield goal and the nitrogen already available in the soil, the user can <Strong>modulate the nitrogen fertilization</Strong> to be applied in the field.

## SAMZ Map

The SAMZ API allows to automatically create a 5 zones SAMZ map based on the most relevant archive imagery of vegetation images:  

- The 2 last context
- The 2 last wet context images
- The last one bare soil image

SAMZ analyzes the cropsâ€™ vegetation behavior from satellite imagery archives representing multiple years of variable weather patterns and delineates areas with a different behavior.

The SAMZ map represents the permanent variability of the field, derived from multiple crop seasons. It shows a spatial representation of the limiting factors of soil through the analysis of the crop-weather-soil interaction.

The SAMZ map is comparable to the classification of several years of yield maps.

The SAMZ maps uses are numerous because they depend on the production limiting factors of the field: 

- The baseline inputs modulation (P, K, CaO...) and the seeds modulation are the first uses as they directly related to the "quality" of the soil.
- The nitrogen variable fertilization plan also allows to take into account the variability of the nitrogen restitution of soil before the crop season and in-season due to better sampling of leaf analyzes to assess the index of nitrgoen nutrition of plants and thus to adjust the provided application dose.

The SAMZ map is sent with the following statistics values on the zones:
- Productivity index for the map and by zone. It corresponds to the average, for each zone, of NDVI calculated on all vegetation images*100.
- Field variability level (low, medium, or high) for the map and by zone
- The most variable class: the class that has the higher NDVI values variability.
- The two classes with the highest inter-class variability: for each class, the Euclidean distance from each of the other class is calculated; then the two farthest classes are identified.
