# Get data on the map

The following sections will guide you through the steps to add layers in QGIS map view. Please be sure to have the plugin panel visible.

<!-- theme: warning -->

> ### Select Polygon(s)
>
>Geosys Platform offers polygon-based maps creation capabilities. You need to have in your layer tree at least one polygon layer loaded.

Within this layer, you can if needed define a selection using QGIS object selection tools.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GEOSYS/qgis-plugin-doc/master/pictures/doc11.png)

On the <Strong>“Geosys plugin – Coverage parameter”</Strong> panel, you will be able to select the layer containing polygon you want to extract maps for. By default, the first polygon in view will be selected. The `drop down` list will contain <Strong>only polygons layers in view</Strong>.

The <Strong>“Selected feature only”</Strong> allows you to get maps only on selected object of the layer define above. 

The <Strong>“Bulk request”</Strong> option allows you to send all geometries (of the layer or the selection based on previous option status) as one single API request. When this option is not checked the tool will send one request per polygon. 

The map type selection allows you to select the type of content you are interesting to get. The following options are available: 

-	Color Composition that will return either a true or false color map (depending on bands available) on an expanded bounding box of polygon.
-	Elevation that will return elevation map clipped on the polygon.
-	In season CVI that will return CVI vegetation index map clipped on the polygon.
-	In season EVI that will return EVI vegetation index map clipped on the polygon
-	In season GNDVI that will return GNDVI vegetation index map clipped on the polygon 
-	In season NDVI that will return NDVI vegetation index map clipped on the polygon
-	In season partial NDVI that will return NDVI vegetation index map clipped on the polygon and only covering a portion of the field
-	In season partial EVI that will 
return EVI vegetation index map clipped on the polygon and only covering a portion of the field
-	OM that will return an organic matter map clipped on the polygon based on user inputs
-	SAMZ that will return a management zones map clipped on the polygon based on user image selection (optional, in this the system will select 5 most relevant images)
-	YGM that will return yield goal map clipped on the polygon based on user inputs
-	YPM that will return yield variability map clipped on the polygon based on user inputs

It is also possible to filter by sensor used to acquire data, for example if user wants only Sentinel data. 

The last parameters are the start and end date for imagery selection. It allows you to select the date range for image selection. This is important to limit the size of the response.

When all search parameters are defined, you can hit the <Strong>“Search map”</Strong> button

The <Strong>“Help”</Strong> button triggers the display of the following screen.

After hitting the <Strong>"Search map"</Strong> button, the plugin will call Geosys Platform for each polygon (layer or selection) to check images available: this is what is called the <Strong>Coverage</Strong> of the polygon.

If the button <Stong>"Next"</Strong> is <Strong>not available</Strong> because this message appears:

It's because the layer does not have a coordinate system. It's important to check that before hitting the <Strong>"Search map"</Strong>.

> ### Get List Of Available Images (Coverage)
>
>While fetching data the panel will look as below

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GEOSYS/qgis-plugin-doc/master/pictures/doc14.png)

Once all data has been retrieved the plugin panel will display a list of coverage data for each selected field as below

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GEOSYS/qgis-plugin-doc/master/pictures/doc15.png)

For each coverage items, the following information is available:
- Map thumbnail on the left
- Field ID of the polygon on Geosys Platform
- Acquisition date
- Sensor
- Coverage type that will be clear. Only no cloudy coverage will be returned.

It is possible to select one or multiple items on the coverage panel, they will appear in blue as below.

The button <Strong>"Back"</Strong> allows you to come back to the coverage parameter.

The button <Strong>"Next"</Strong> allows you to go back to the map extraction panel

<!-- theme: warning -->
> ### Get Maps
>
>The <Strong>"Get Map"</Strong> panel offers the oppurtunity to set map creation parameters and map extraction parameters

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GEOSYS/qgis-plugin-doc/master/pictures/doc16.png)

Map creation parameters are:
- Yield average for yield variability map creation
- Yield average, min and max for yield goal map creation
- Organic matter average for OM map creation
- Number of zones for SaMZ map creation

Geosys platform provides the following data extraction format:
- For map as raster dataset
   - Png with word file
   - GeoTiff
- For map as vector dataset
   - Esri shapefile
   - KMZ

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GEOSYS/qgis-plugin-doc/master/pictures/doc17.png)

By clicking on the <Strong>"Creat Map"</Strong> button, data extraction and loading on the map will start. It is important to keep in mind that data will be exported in the folder, before being loaded on the map: this means that they will be available offline.

Here is an example of maps loaded on the map view:

The plugin can provide you, in optional, the Hotspots of your field. When hitting on the <Strong>"Fetch Hotspots"</Strong> button, you will have two options:

- Recover the hotspot by polygon
- Recover the hotspot for each polygon part

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GEOSYS/qgis-plugin-doc/master/pictures/doc19.png)

Here is an example of maps loaded on the map view with the first hotspot option, one spot per polygon:

Here is an example of maps loaded on the map view with the second hotspot option, one spot for each polygon:
